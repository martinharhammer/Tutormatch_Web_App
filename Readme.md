# TutorMatch

## Project Overview

**TutorMatch** is a web-based platform designed to connect university students for peer tutoring and academic support. By integrating elements of peer tutoring and exchange programs, TutorMatch enables students to find study partners based on shared academic interests.

## Purpose

The platform provides a **matching system** where students can sign up to **offer tutoring in specific subjects** or **seek assistance in areas they need help with**. User verification is done via university-issued email addresses to ensure authenticity. Initially, access will be limited to **TU students**, with future expansion planned for other universities.

TutorMatch suggests study partners based on **mutual subject interests**. Matches occur when two students can **tutor each other in at least one subject**. Once matched, they can use the **built-in chat** to coordinate study sessions. Additional safety features, such as **user reporting**, ensure a secure learning environment.

## Key Features for Administrators

Administrators have tools to:
- **Manage available subjects** by adding or updating academic topics.
- **Monitor user reports** to maintain a safe environment.
- **Block users** who violate platform policies.
- **Expand university access** by adding more institution email identifiers.
